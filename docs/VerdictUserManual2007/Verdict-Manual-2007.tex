\begin{abstract}
\verd\ is a collection of subroutines for evaluating the geometric qualities
of triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, and hexahedra using a variety of
metrics.
A metric is a real number assigned to one of these shapes depending on its
particular vertex coordinates.
These metrics are used to evaluate the input to finite element, finite volume,
boundary element, and other types of solvers that approximate the solution to
partial differential equations defined over regions of space.
The geometric qualities of these regions is usually strongly tied to the
accuracy these solvers are able to obtain in their approximations.

The subroutines are written in C++ and have a simple C interface.
Each metric may be evaluated individually or in combination.
When multiple metrics are evaluated at once, they share common
calculations to lower the cost of the evaluation.
